## Overview

### üèîÔ∏è The Challenge

Wanting to showcase my ultimate gaming and productivity workspace setup while improving my frontend development skills with Vue.js and TypeScript, I created BattleStation - an interactive portfolio for visualizing my complete desk setup and high-end components.

Users can explore a responsive interface that presents my gaming/productivity battlestation with detailed component specifications, interactive views, and comprehensive hardware breakdown. The application features a modern UI with smooth transitions, responsive design, and detailed product information for each component in my setup.

I've implemented a complete showcase that allows visitors to navigate through different categories of my equipment - from the powerful gaming PC with Ryzen 7 5800X and RTX 3060Ti, through the MacBook Pro M3 for mobile productivity, to the professional audio setup with EDIFIER speakers and Novox NC1 microphone.
